# 2025-09-26 – Dev Journal
_Last updated: 1:00 PM CT_

## 📌 Overview
Started a public dev journal with GitHub Pages. Keeping it simple and manual while I’m at work.

---

## ✅ Checkpoint 1 — Morning (around 10:30 AM)
- Created `docs/index.md` (landing page).
- Added `docs/_config.yml` with the **minima** theme.
- Started `docs/journal/2025-09-26.md` (this entry).
- Settled on daily + weekly templates to keep posts readable for friends.

**Notes:** Keeping comments (Giscus) out of scope for MVP.

---

## ✅ Checkpoint 2 — Midday (around 1:00 PM)
- Drafted the first pass of today’s entry (sections + placeholders).
- Confirmed plan: publish from `/docs` → **Settings → Pages** still to do.

---

## ⛔ Blockers
- Pages not enabled yet (won’t have a public URL until I flip the switch).

---

## 🔮 What’s Next (later today)
- [ ] Enable GitHub Pages (main → `/docs`) and verify URL.
- [x] Link today’s entry from `docs/index.md` under “Recent Entries”.
- [ ] (Optional) Add `/docs/journal/templates/daily.md` and `weekly.md`.

---

## 🧠 Reflections (WIP)
- Keeping everything in GitHub should make sharing with friends dead simple.
